This Project demonstrate use of ForkJoin framework in Java Parallel Processing.

The ForkJoin Framework is explained in a very simple way by writing a java program for calculating sum of 10 digits. 

Our Program First FORK this scenario into two task task. One Task to calculate the sum of 1 to 5 digits. The other task to calculate the sum of 6 to 10 digits. Both task will be executed in parallel. The result of these task are joined together to derive the final result.

you can change the array used to hold the 10 digits to an ArrayList and use the same logic to calculate the sum of N number in a list.

Thanks... Happy learning....
